Eye-Controlled-Mouse-Cursor

This program is a Python script that tracks the movement of your eyes and translates it as mouse movements on screen. The calibration may not be right for all the systems, but it works fine on the testing system. This script requires the Computer Vision package to be installed on your system. It also requires the attached .xml file to figure out the different locations on face.
